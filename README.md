Copy of commonly used tools in CTF competitions. Clone into ~/ with commands below. Also Peda only works with Python 2 at the moment so older versions of gdb are also available in the CTF directory.

```
echo "set auto-load safe-path /" >> ~/.gdbinit;
git clone https://github.com/longld/peda.git ~/peda ;
git clone https://github.com/blankwall/Template.git ~/Template
```
